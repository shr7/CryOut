**CryOut

CryOut has been made with a motive to act as a connecting link between those who seek help and those who are capable of providing help.

###Features
  •	**File A Complaint**
    The users who seek help can access the portal and register their complaints with us. These complaints will then be available to all the NGOs and Policemen registered with us who can view them and provide help as required. The users will be authenticated by their Aadhar numbers.

  •	**Discussion Forum**
    This is a forum for people who wish to discuss their problems with others and seek their views. The visitors on the app can comment on the posts offering their viewpoints and advise those in distress.

  •	**Want to Help**
    This is a login system provided for the NGOs and policemen to see the complaints which they can address. 

  •	**SOS**
    A button is available on the app at all times which on being clicked sends an email to the server. We authenticate the request and send it to the policemen or NGOs.
